## Extracting Data from Streams - Activity

In the folder, there are 4 Python Scripts.  Each script will extract data from a different streaming source.  The scripts are:

1. `extract_from_kenisis.py`
2. `extract_from_pub_sub.py`
3. `extract_from_rabbitmq.py`

### Activity 1

Your Peer Group will explore one of the scripts (designated by your trainer) and then present back to the team on what the script does and how it works.

***Timebox:*** 45 minutes (including presentations: 30 mins for exploration, 15 mins for presentations - 5 mins per team)

### Activity 2

Once all the presentations are complete, the team will discuss the following questions:

1. What are the commonalities between the scripts?
2. What are the differences between the scripts?
3. What are the key considerations when extracting data from a stream?

In addition to this, the team will put together a summary of how extracting from a stream works.

***Timebox:*** 15 minutes
